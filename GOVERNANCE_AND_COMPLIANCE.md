3. **Coverage Layer**: Historical tracking and trend analysis
4. **Notification Layer**: Real-time communication and reporting
5. **Audit Layer**: Complete traceability and compliance logging

---

## Multi-Stage Enforcement Pipeline

### Stage 1: Pre-Commit Validation

**Purpose**: Prevent problematic code from entering the repository

**Components**:
- **Secrets Detection**: Regex-based scanning for API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Policy Compliance**: Validation against governance rules
- **Code Formatting**: Automated formatting with Black
- **Linting**: Style and quality checks with Ruff
- **Type Checking**: Optional MyPy validation
- **Unit Tests**: Quick validation of core functionality

**Behavior**:
- **Local Mode**: Auto-fixes issues where possible
- **CI Mode**: Check-only with detailed error reporting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even with missing dependencies

### Stage 2: Coverage Enforcement

**Purpose**: Maintain minimum code coverage thresholds

**Components**:
- **Threshold Validation**: Enforces minimum coverage requirements
- **Historical Tracking**: Stores coverage data with timestamps
- **Delta Calculation**: Tracks coverage changes over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies coverage patterns and anomalies

**Enforcement**:
- **Hard Fail**: Builds fail below minimum threshold (85%)
- **Warning**: Alerts when below warning threshold (90%)
- **Target**: Aspirational coverage goal (95%)

### Stage 3: Merge Readiness Assessment

**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation of code readiness for production

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
merge_score = (
    coverage_score * 0.40 +    # Coverage weight: 40%
    test_score * 0.20 +        # Tests weight: 20%
    lint_score * 0.20 +        # Linting weight: 20%
    policy_score * 0.20        # Policy weight: 20%
)
```

**Thresholds**:
- **≥90**: Ready to ship
- **≥80**: Almost there (minor improvements needed)
- **<80**: Action required (significant issues)

### Stage 4: Post-Push Analysis

**Purpose**: Continuous monitoring and team communication

**Components**:
- **Coverage Tracking**: Updates historical data
- **Trend Reporting**: Generates sparkline visualizations
- **Slack Integration**: Rich notifications with metrics
- **Audit Logging**: Records all governance actions

---

## Centralized Policy Management

### Policy Configuration (`merge_policy.yml`)

The governance system uses a centralized YAML configuration file that defines all quality gates and enforcement rules:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
enforcement_mode: "strict"  # strict, warn, disabled
fail_on_violation: true

coverage:
  enabled: true
  minimum: 85
  warning: 90
  target: 95
  measurement: "line"
  exclude_patterns:
    - "tests/*"
    - "scripts/*"
    - "migrations/*"

testing:
  enabled: true
  minimum_pass_rate: 100
  required_test_types:
    - "unit"
    - "integration"

linting:
  enabled: true
  tools:
    ruff:
      enabled: true
      max_violations: 0
    black:
      enabled: true
      check_mode: true
  auto_fix: false  # CI mode: check only

merge_score:
  enabled: true
  passing_threshold: 80
  weights:
    coverage: 40
    tests: 20
    linting: 20
    policy: 20
```

### Policy Validation

The system includes comprehensive schema validation:

- **Type Checking**: Validates data types for all configuration values
- **Range Validation**: Ensures thresholds are within acceptable ranges
- **Dependency Validation**: Verifies required sections are present
- **Consistency Checks**: Validates relationships between configuration values

## Merge Readiness Scoring Model

### Scoring Components

#### 1. Coverage Score (40% Weight)
```python
coverage_score = min((actual_coverage / target_coverage) * 100, 100)
```

#### 2. Test Score (20% Weight)
```python
test_score = (tests_passed / tests_total) * 100
```

#### 3. Linting Score (20% Weight)
```python
lint_score = max(100 - (violations * penalty_per_violation), 0)
```

#### 4. Policy Score (20% Weight)
```python
policy_score = 100 if policy_compliant else 0
```

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | 🎉 Ready to ship | None |
| 80-89 | ⚠️ Almost there | Minor improvements |
| 70-79 | 🚨 Action required | Significant issues |
| <70 | ❌ Blocked | Major remediation |

---

## Audit Logging & Traceability

### Audit Trail Components

1. **Git Hook Execution**: All hook executions logged with timestamps
2. **Policy Violations**: Detailed records of all policy violations
3. **Coverage Changes**: Historical coverage data with deltas
4. **Merge Scores**: Complete scoring history with component breakdowns
5. **Bypass Attempts**: Detection and logging of `--no-verify` usage

### Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "pre_commit_execution",
  "result": "success",
  "duration_ms": 1250,
  "checks_performed": [
    "secrets_detection",
    "policy_compliance", 
    "code_formatting",
    "linting",
    "unit_tests"
  ],
  "violations": [],
  "auto_fixes": 3,
  "user": "developer@example.com",
  "commit_hash": "abc123def456"
}
```

### Audit Storage
