## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix: Spec Reference Missing
Add to PR description:
```
Spec: /specs/my-feature.md
```

### Fix: Coverage Too Low
```bash
# Check current coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term

# Add tests
# Re-run until ≥80%
```

### Fix: Lint Errors
```bash
# Auto-fix
ruff check --fix .
black .

# Verify
ruff check .
```

### Fix: Secrets Detected
