## 🔄 Developer Experience

### Before Implementation
```
Developer workflow:
1. Write code
2. Manually run linters (often forgotten)
3. Run tests (slow, sequential)
4. Push and hope CI passes
5. Wait 12 minutes for results
6. Debug CI failures remotely
7. Repeat
```

### After Implementation ✅
```
Developer workflow:
1. Write code
2. Run: make verify-ci (one command)
3. Push with confidence
4. CI completes in 6 minutes
5. Auto-retry handles flaky tests
6. Clear readiness score in PR
7. Merge when ≥90%
```

**Result: Happier, more productive developers**
