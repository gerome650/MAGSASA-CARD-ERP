## 🔍 Validation Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Test merge score calculation
pytest tests/test_merge_score_calculation.py -v

# Test payload validation
pytest tests/test_validate_payload_structure.py -v

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Complete CI pipeline
make ci

# Individual validation steps
make validate-payload
make validate-all
make validate-schema
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# 1. Check merge quality state
cat merge_quality_state.json | jq .

# 2. Validate example payload
python scripts/validate_slack_payload.py example_payload.json --suggest-fixes

# 3. Generate test payload
python scripts/update_merge_scores.py \
  --team-goal 90.0 \
  --branch test-branch \
  --commit abc123 \
  --actor testuser

# 4. Build Slack message
python scripts/slack_merge_digest.py \
  --payload merge_slack_payload.json \
  --repo test/repo \
  --branch test-branch \
  --commit abc123 \
  --actor testuser \
  --output slack_test_message.json

# 5. Validate Slack message
python scripts/validate_slack_payload.py slack_test_message.json
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Score Calculation Example
```json
{
  "total_score": 92.0,
  "breakdown": {
    "syntax": 100.0,
    "lint": 94.0,
    "tests": 92.0,
    "coverage": 86.0,
    "security": 100.0
  }
}
```

### State Tracking Example
```json
{
  "history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-05T23:14:29.693774+00:00",
      "score": 92.0,
      "breakdown": {...},
      "pr_metadata": {...},
      "delta_vs_previous": 4.0
    }
  ],
  "streak_below_goal": 0,
  "early_warning": false,
  "auto_fail": false,
  "team_goal": 90
}
```
