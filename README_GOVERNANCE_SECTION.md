# 🛡️ Governance & Quality Enforcement

> **Copy this section into your main README.md**

This repository implements a comprehensive **CI/CD governance system** that automatically enforces quality standards, tracks metrics, and provides real-time feedback.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install Quality Gates

```bash
# Install git hooks for local enforcement
make install-governance-hooks

# Run full quality check
make verify-all
```

### Check Your Status

```bash
# Generate governance report
make governance-report

# Calculate merge readiness score
make calculate-merge-score
```

## 📊 Quality Standards

Our codebase maintains these standards:

| Metric | Minimum | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Code Coverage** | 85% | 95% | ![Coverage](badges/coverage.svg) |
| **Test Pass Rate** | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| **Linting Violations** | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| **Merge Score** | 80/100 | 95/100 | 🎯 |

## 🪝 Automated Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Hook (Local)

Runs automatically before each commit:

1. ✨ **Format code** with Black
2. 🧹 **Lint code** with Ruff
3. 🔍 **Type check** with Mypy
4. 🧪 **Run unit tests**

**Bypass (emergency only):** `git commit --no-verify`

### CI/CD Pipeline (Remote)

Runs on every pull request:

1. **Lint & Format Check** - Ensures code style compliance
2. **Tests & Coverage** - Runs full test suite with coverage tracking
3. **Policy Check** - Validates against governance policies
4. **Merge Score** - Calculates readiness score (0-100)
5. **Slack Notification** - Notifies team with PR author mention

**PR Status:**
- ✅ **Passing:** All gates pass, score ≥80
- ❌ **Failing:** One or more gates fail, merge blocked

---

## 📈 Coverage Tracking

We track code coverage over time with **visual trends**:

```
Current Coverage: 87.5%
Trend: ▁▃▄▆█ ↑
```

**Commands:**
```bash
make coverage-trend    # View trend report
make coverage-badge    # Generate badge
make enforce-coverage  # Check thresholds
```

---

## 🎯 Merge Readiness Score

Every PR gets a **merge readiness score** (0-100):

```
Merge Score = Coverage×30% + Tests×30% + Linting×20% + Reviews×15% + Docs×5%
```

**Minimum passing score:** 80/100

**Example:**
```
🎯 Merge Score: 85.0/100 (✅ PASS)
   - Coverage:       92.1 / 100
   - Tests Passing:  100.0 / 100
   - Linting:        95.0 / 100
   - Reviews:        50.0 / 100
   - Documentation:  50.0 / 100
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Governance policies are defined in `merge_policy.yml`:

```yaml
coverage:
  minimum: 85    # Hard fail below this
  warning: 90    # Warning if below this
  target: 95     # Aspirational target

testing:
  minimum_pass_rate: 100  # All tests must pass

linting:
  tools:
    ruff:
      max_violations: 0  # Zero tolerance

merge_score:
  passing_threshold: 80  # Minimum to merge
```

**Customize thresholds** to match your project maturity.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Coverage too low:**
```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

**Linting failures:**
