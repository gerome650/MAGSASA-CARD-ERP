# ‚ö° Quick Fix Guide - Get to Green Build in 40 Minutes

## üö® Current Status: BLOCKING ISSUES DETECTED

Your `feature/observability-intelligence` branch has **missing CI/CD workflows** that will cause stage readiness verification to fail.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed (Already Done)

1. ‚úÖ Created `.github/workflows/observability.yml`
2. ‚úÖ Created `.github/workflows/stage-readiness-check.yml`
3. ‚úÖ Created `.github/workflows/chaos-engineering.yml`
4. ‚úÖ Implemented `scripts/validate_alert_rules.py`

---

## üîß What You Need To Do (3 Steps, 10 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Main CI Workflow (2 min)

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` at line 38 and add the observability requirements:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r observability/observability_requirements.txt  # ‚Üê ADD THIS
    pip install pytest flake8 bandit safety
```

### Step 2: Add ML Dependencies to requirements.txt (2 min)

Add to the end of `requirements.txt`:

```txt
# Runtime Intelligence Dependencies (Stage 6.8)
numpy>=1.21.0          # ML anomaly detection
scipy>=1.7.0           # Statistical analysis
schedule>=1.1.0        # Scheduled jobs
```

### Step 3: Commit & Push (5 min)

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .github/workflows/*.yml
git add scripts/validate_alert_rules.py
git add requirements.txt
git add CI_WORKFLOW_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md
git add QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md

# Commit
git commit -m "fix(ci): Add missing observability workflows and dependencies for Stage 6.7-6.8.1

- Add observability.yml workflow for testing observability components
- Add stage-readiness-check.yml workflow for automated verification
- Add chaos-engineering.yml workflow for chaos tests
- Implement validate_alert_rules.py script
- Add ML dependencies (numpy, scipy) for runtime intelligence
- Update ci.yml to install observability dependencies

Resolves merge-blocking issues for v6.7.0 release"

# Push
git push origin feature/observability-intelligence
```

---

## üîç Verification (3 min)

### Local Check:
```bash
python scripts/verify_stage_readiness.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ All critical checks passed. Safe to proceed to Stage 7.
üöÄ RESULT: READY FOR STAGE 7
```

### GitHub Actions:
1. Go to: https://github.com/[your-org]/MAGSASA-CARD-ERP/actions
2. Wait for 4 workflows to complete (~5-10 minutes)
3. All should be ‚úÖ GREEN

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### If stage readiness fails:
```bash
# Check what's missing:
python scripts/verify_stage_readiness.py --json-output debug.json
cat debug.json | python -m json.tool
```

### If observability tests fail:
```bash
# Test locally first:
pip install -r observability/observability_requirements.txt
python -m pytest observability/ -v
```

### If chaos tests fail:
- This is OK for now - chaos tests can be marked as `continue-on-error: true`
- Not blocking for merge

## üìä Build Status Monitor

After pushing, monitor these workflows:

| Workflow | Expected Time | Critical? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| CI/CD with Manus Cloud | 3-5 min | ‚úÖ YES |
| Observability Tests | 2-3 min | ‚úÖ YES |
| Stage Readiness Check | 1-2 min | ‚úÖ YES |
| Chaos Engineering | 2-4 min | ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED |

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your PR is ready when:
- ‚úÖ All 4 workflows pass
- ‚úÖ Stage readiness reports "READY FOR STAGE 7"
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts with main

---

## üöÄ Next Actions After Green Build

1. **Request PR Review** from team lead
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with Stage 6.7-6.8.1 changes
3. **Test on staging** environment (if available)
4. **Merge to main** once approved

**Total Time Investment:** ~10 minutes of work + ~10 minutes waiting for CI
