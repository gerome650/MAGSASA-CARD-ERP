# üõ°Ô∏è CI/CD Governance & Automation System

A complete CI/CD governance layer for the MAGSASA-CARD-ERP Python monorepo that enforces quality, security, and merge-readiness automatically before code reaches `main` or `release/*` branches.

## üéØ System Overview

This system provides:
- **Pre-commit automation** with selective testing and auto-fixing
- **Post-push hooks** with rich Slack notifications
- **Merge gates** that block low-quality PRs
- **Policy enforcement** through centralized configuration
- **Trend analysis** and team metrics
- **Developer experience** enhancements

## üìã Components

### 1. ü™ù Pre-Commit Automation (`scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py`)

Runs comprehensive pre-commit checks:
- **Black formatting** with auto-fix and re-staging
- **Ruff linting** with auto-fix
- **Selective pytest** execution (only tests related to changed files)
- **Full test suite** for `main`/`release/*` branches or with `--full` flag
- **Coverage validation** against policy thresholds
- **Slack notifications** with detailed summary

```bash
# Run pre-commit checks
python scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py

# Run with full test suite
python scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py --full

# Skip Slack notifications
python scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py --no-slack
```

### 2. üöÄ Post-Push Hook (`scripts/hooks/post_push.py`)

Provides comprehensive CI reporting after git push:
- **Lint metrics** (Ruff/Black status)
- **Test coverage** with trend analysis
- **PR diff analysis** (files, lines added/removed)
- **Merge readiness scoring** based on policy weights
- **Rich Slack reports** with PR links and metadata
- **GitHub API integration** for PR information

```bash
# Run post-push checks
python scripts/hooks/post_push.py

# Specify PR number manually
python scripts/hooks/post_push.py --pr-number 123
```

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Merge Gate GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/merge-gate.yml`)

Enforces merge-blocking rules on every PR to protected branches:
- **Code quality checks** (Black, Ruff, MyPy)
- **Security scans** (Bandit, Safety)
- **Comprehensive testing** with coverage enforcement
- **Merge readiness scoring** with weighted components
- **Automatic blocking** for low-quality PRs
- **Slack notifications** with merge status

### 4. üß™ CI Check Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-check.yml`)

Runs on every push and PR with enhanced features:
- **Multi-component scoring** (formatting, linting, tests, security, coverage)
- **Trend analysis** with rolling averages
- **Early warning system** for declining quality
- **Team performance metrics**
- **Comprehensive reporting** with Slack integration

### 5. üìú Central Policy Config (`merge_policy.yml`)

Defines all CI enforcement rules in one place:

```yaml
coverage:
  min_percent: 85
  fail_threshold: 80
  warning_threshold: 82

merge_scoring:
  weights:
    coverage: 0.3
    tests: 0.25
    linting: 0.2
    security: 0.15
    reviewers: 0.1
  min_score: 90
  goal_score: 95
  warning_score: 85

slack:
  channel: "#dev-ci-checks"
  webhook_secret: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### 6. üß† Policy Loader Utility (`scripts/utils/policy_loader.py`)

Centralized policy loading with schema validation:
- **JSON schema validation** for policy structure
- **Business rule validation** (thresholds, weight sums)
- **Caching** for performance
- **Error handling** with detailed messages
- **CLI interface** for validation

```python
from scripts.utils.policy_loader import get_policy, get_coverage_threshold

policy = get_policy()
coverage_threshold = get_coverage_threshold()

if current_coverage < coverage_threshold["min_percent"]:
    raise ValueError("Coverage below threshold")
```

### 7. üìä Merge Dashboard CLI (`scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py`)

Visualizes merge readiness scores and trends:
- **GitHub API integration** for PR data
- **Team performance metrics**
- **Trend analysis** with weekly breakdowns
- **Multiple output formats** (HTML, JSON, terminal)
- **Historical analysis** with configurable time ranges

```bash
# Generate HTML dashboard
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --output html --days 30

# JSON report for automation
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --output json --days 7

# Terminal output with trends
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --trends --team-metrics
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install pytest pytest-cov black ruff mypy bandit safety jsonschema pyyaml requests

### Pre-Commit Workflow

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Stage files** with `git add`
3. **Commit** - pre-commit hook runs automatically:
   - Auto-fixes formatting and linting issues
   - Runs selective tests based on changed files
   - Validates coverage thresholds
   - Sends Slack notification
4. **Push** - post-push hook runs automatically:
   - Analyzes PR diff and impact
   - Calculates merge readiness score
   - Sends rich Slack report with PR links

### Post-Push Workflow

1. **Push changes** to remote branch
2. **Post-push hook** runs automatically:
   - Gathers PR metadata from GitHub API
   - Calculates comprehensive metrics
   - Determines merge readiness status
   - Sends Slack notification with PR links
3. **Create PR** if not already created
4. **Merge gate** runs on PR:
   - Enforces quality standards
   - Blocks low-quality PRs
   - Updates PR with detailed status

- **üü† Warning (80-89%)**: Merge with caution
- **üî¥ Blocked (<80%)**: Merge blocked

## üîß Configuration

### Policy Configuration (`merge_policy.yml`)

All CI enforcement rules are centralized in this file:

```yaml
# Coverage requirements
coverage:
  min_percent: 85          # Minimum coverage for merge
  fail_threshold: 80       # Coverage threshold for failure
  warning_threshold: 82    # Coverage threshold for warnings

# Test requirements
tests:
  max_failures: 0          # Maximum allowed test failures
  max_skipped: 5           # Maximum allowed skipped tests
  timeout_seconds: 300     # Test timeout in seconds

# Merge scoring weights
merge_scoring:
  weights:
    coverage: 0.3          # 30% weight for coverage
    tests: 0.25            # 25% weight for tests
    linting: 0.2           # 20% weight for linting
    security: 0.15         # 15% weight for security
    reviewers: 0.1         # 10% weight for reviewers
  min_score: 90            # Minimum score for merge
  goal_score: 95           # Target score for excellence
  warning_score: 85        # Warning threshold
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Slack Integration
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL

# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Optional: Custom policy file
MERGE_POLICY_FILE=path/to/custom_policy.yml
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Policy Loader Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
make test-policy-loader

# Or directly with pytest
pytest tests/test_policy_loader.py -v
```

### Test Individual Components

```bash
# Test pre-commit automation
python scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py --verbose

# Test post-push automation
python scripts/hooks/post_push.py --verbose

# Test policy validation
python scripts/utils/policy_loader.py --verbose
```

## üìä Dashboard and Analytics

### Generate HTML Dashboard

```bash
# Generate interactive HTML dashboard
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --output html --days 30

# Open in browser
open merge_dashboard_20240101_120000.html
```

### Team Performance Metrics

```bash
# Show team metrics in terminal
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --team-metrics --trends

# Export JSON for analysis
python scripts/metrics/merge_dashboard.py --output json --days 7 > metrics.json
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slack notifications not working**
   ```bash
   # Check webhook URL
   echo $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   
   # Test webhook manually
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"text":"Test message"}' \
     $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```

2. **GitHub API rate limits**
   ```bash
   # Check token permissions
   curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/user
   ```

3. **Policy validation failures**
   ```bash
   # Validate policy file
   python scripts/utils/policy_loader.py --verbose
   
   # Check schema compliance
   make validate-policy
   ```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run with debug output
python scripts/hooks/pre_commit.py --verbose
```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing CI
