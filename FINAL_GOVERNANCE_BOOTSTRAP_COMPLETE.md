cp merge_policy.yml /path/to/new/repo/
cp -r scripts/utils /path/to/new/repo/scripts/
cp -r scripts/hooks /path/to/new/repo/scripts/
cp -r scripts/metrics /path/to/new/repo/scripts/
cp scripts/notify_slack_enhanced.py /path/to/new/repo/scripts/
cp scripts/validate_governance_setup.py /path/to/new/repo/scripts/

# CI/CD
cp .github/workflows/merge-gate.yml /path/to/new/repo/.github/workflows/

# Docs
cp PR_AUTHOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md /path/to/new/repo/
cp GOVERNANCE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md /path/to/new/repo/
```

### 2. Customize (10 minutes)

```bash
# Edit merge_policy.yml for your project
vim merge_policy.yml

# Update thresholds, team names, Slack channels
```

### 3. Install (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies

## 🎯 Business Value

### Before Governance System

- ❌ Manual PR reviews (15 min each)
- ❌ Inconsistent quality enforcement
- ❌ Coverage tracking is ad-hoc
- ❌ No team visibility into trends
- ❌ Quality issues discovered late

### After Governance System

- ✅ **Automated enforcement** (instant feedback)
- ✅ **Consistent standards** (same rules for all)
- ✅ **Automatic tracking** (trends + sparklines)
- ✅ **Team notifications** (Slack with author mentions)
- ✅ **Early detection** (issues caught pre-merge)

### ROI Estimate

**Time Saved per Week:**
- PR reviews: 15 min → 5 min (10 min × 20 PRs = **3.3 hours/week**)
- Coverage tracking: 10 min/day → 0 min (**50 min/week**)
- Quality debugging: 2 hours → 30 min (**1.5 hours/week**)

**Total:** ~**5 hours/week saved** per developer

**Quality Improvement:**
- Defect rate: Expected **40% reduction**
- Coverage: Trend visibility → **continuous improvement**
- Team confidence: **Higher** with automated gates
