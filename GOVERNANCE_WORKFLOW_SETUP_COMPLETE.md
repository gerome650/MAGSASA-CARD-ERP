## 🔍 What Each Check Does

### 1. 📋 Spec Reference Validation
**Purpose:** Ensures all PRs are backed by design documents

**Checks for patterns:**
- `/specs/` or `specs/` in PR body
- `Spec:` or `Specification:` keywords
- `References:` links
- `Design doc:` references
- `spec-XXX` identifiers

**Exemptions:**
- Bot PRs (`[bot]`)
- Dependency updates (`chore(deps)`)
- Documentation PRs (`docs:`)

**Failure Message:**
> ❌ PR must include a spec reference in the body or title

### 2. 🔍 Duplicate Test Detection
**Purpose:** Prevents test name collisions that can cause confusion

**Scans:**
- All `test_*.py` files in `tests/` directory
- Looks for duplicate function names starting with `test_`
- Warns about duplicate test class names

**Example:**
```python
# BAD - Duplicate detected
def test_user_creation():  # File 1
def test_user_creation():  # File 2 - DUPLICATE!

# GOOD - Unique names
def test_user_creation_with_email():
def test_user_creation_with_phone():
```

### 3. 📁 Directory Structure Enforcement
**Purpose:** Maintains consistent project organization

**Validates presence of:**
- `src/` - Source code
- `tests/` - Test files
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation

**Warns about:**
- Temporary directories (`temp/`, `tmp/`, `scratch/`)
- Missing `__init__.py` in Python packages

### 4. 🔐 Secrets Scanning
**Purpose:** Prevents accidental credential exposure

**Detects patterns:**
- Hardcoded passwords (`password = "..."`)
- API keys (`api_key = "..."`)
- AWS access keys (`AKIA...`)
- GitHub tokens (`ghp_...`)
- OpenAI keys (`sk-...`)
- Generic secrets (`secret = "..."`)
- Tokens (`token = "..."`)

**Bypass mechanism:**
```python
# Allowed with comment
api_key = "test_key_123"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

**Exclusions:**
- Test files (`test_*.py`)
- Example files
- Template files

### 5. 📊 Coverage Enforcement
**Purpose:** Maintains high test quality

**Requirements:**
- Minimum coverage: **80%**
- Runs full test suite with coverage
- Generates `coverage.json` report

**Process:**
1. Installs dependencies with `uv`
2. Runs `pytest` with coverage
3. Validates against threshold
4. Uploads coverage report as artifact

**Failure Example:**
```
❌ Coverage 75.3% is below threshold 80%
```

### 6. 🧹 Ruff Linting
**Purpose:** Enforces consistent code style

**Checks:**
- Code style violations
- Import sorting
- Unused variables
- Type hint issues
- Security issues (B*** rules)

**Output Format:**
- GitHub annotations (inline comments on files)
- JSON report (uploaded as artifact)
- Violation count summary

**Auto-fix Available:**
```bash
ruff check --fix .
```

### 7. 📋 Governance Summary
**Purpose:** Provides clear status overview

**Generates:**
1. **Job Summary** - Visible in Actions tab
2. **PR Comment** - Posted directly to PR

**Summary includes:**
- Overall status (✅ or ❌)
- Score: X/6 checks passed
- Detailed results table
- Direct link to workflow run

## 🚀 How to Use the Governance Workflow

### For Developers: Creating a PR

#### Step 1: Write a Specification
```bash
# Create spec file
touch specs/my-feature-spec.md

# Use template
cp specs/spec-template.md specs/my-feature-spec.md
```

#### Step 2: Reference Spec in PR
When creating your PR, include the spec reference in the description:

```markdown
## Summary
This PR implements the new authentication feature.

## Specification
Spec: /specs/authentication-v2.md

## Changes
- Added JWT authentication
- Updated user model
- Added tests
```

#### Step 3: Ensure Tests Pass
```bash
# Run tests locally
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term

# Check coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80
```

#### Step 4: Fix Lint Issues
```bash
# Auto-fix most issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
black .

# Check remaining issues
ruff check .
```

#### Step 5: Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
gh pr create --title "Add authentication feature" \
             --body-file pr-description.md
```

#### Step 6: Monitor Governance Check
1. Go to GitHub PR page
2. Wait for "🧑‍⚖️ PR Governance Validation" to complete
3. Review the automated comment
4. Fix any failing checks

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjusting Coverage Threshold

Edit line 386 in `.github/workflows/pr-governance-check.yml`:

```yaml
# Current: 80%
THRESHOLD=80

# Change to 85%
THRESHOLD=85
```

### Disabling Specific Checks

Comment out the job in the workflow file:

```yaml
# jobs:
#   secrets-scanning:  # Disable this check
#     name: 🔐 Secrets Scanning
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     ...
```

### Adding Custom Patterns

Add to the patterns array in the respective job:

```yaml
# For secrets scanning
PATTERNS=(
  "password\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}"
  "custom_secret_pattern"  # Add here
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Appearing in GitHub

**Check:**
1. Workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
2. File has `.yml` extension
3. YAML syntax is valid
4. Branch is pushed to remote

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la .github/workflows/pr-governance-check.yml

# Validate YAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/pr-governance-check.yml'))"

# Check git status
git status

# Push if needed
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Spec Reference Check Failing

**Common causes:**
- No spec reference in PR description
- Spec reference not matching patterns
- PR is not exempt but should be

**Fix:**
Add spec reference to PR description:
```markdown
Spec: /specs/my-feature.md
```

Or mark as documentation PR:
```
docs: Update README
```

### Coverage Check Failing

**Common causes:**
- Coverage below 80%
- Tests not running
- Dependencies not installed

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run tests locally
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Open coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# Add tests for uncovered code
```

### Secrets Scanning False Positives

**Fix:**
Add allowlist comment:
```python
test_api_key = "fake_key_123"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```
