## 📊 Merge Score Calculation

### Formula

```
Total Score = (Coverage × 30%) + (Tests × 30%) + (Linting × 20%) + (Reviews × 15%) + (Docs × 5%)
```

### Component Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Max Score | Calculation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | 30% | 100 | Linear: (actual/target) × 100 |
| **Tests Passing** | 30% | 100 | Percentage: (passed/total) × 100 |
| **Linting** | 20% | 100 | Penalty: 100 - (violations × 5) |
| **Reviews** | 15% | 100 | 50 points per review |
| **Documentation** | 5% | 100 | 50 if has description |

### Thresholds

- **Passing:** ≥80/100
- **Blocking:** <80/100

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Daily Development

```bash
# Morning - Check status
make governance-report

# Before committing (automatic via hook)
git commit -m "Add feature"
# → Runs: format → lint → type check → tests

# Before pushing
make verify-all

# After push (automatic via hook)
git push
# → Runs: coverage check → Slack notification
```

### Scenario 2: Pull Request

```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create --title "Add feature" --body "Description"

# CI automatically runs:
# 1. Lint & format checks
# 2. Tests & coverage
# 3. Policy compliance check
# 4. Merge score calculation
# 5. Slack notification

# PR comment shows:
# - Coverage: 87.5% ▁▃▄▆█
# - Tests: 50/50 passed
# - Merge Score: 85/100 ✅
# - Status: ✅ READY TO MERGE
```

### Scenario 3: Release Branch

```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Enhanced checks run automatically
make release-check

# Stricter enforcement:
# - Full test suite
