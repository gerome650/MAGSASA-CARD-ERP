## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Developer Workflow
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
cd MAGSASA-CARD-ERP
make setup

# 2. Before pushing code
make preflight-quick    # Fast check (lint + test)
make verify-ci          # Full verification
make security-scan      # Security audit

# 3. Check CI health
make ci-health
cat reports/ci_health.md

# Enforces ≥90% readiness before merge
python scripts/update_release_dashboard.py --check-only
```

**Criteria Checked:**
1. ✅ Linting passed (Ruff, Black, MyPy)
2. ✅ Tests passed (with coverage ≥80%)
3. ✅ Security scan clean
4. ✅ Build successful
5. ✅ MCP validation passed
6. ✅ Overall readiness ≥90%

### Merge Blocking
- PRs cannot merge if readiness <90%
- CI must pass all verification gates
- Security issues must be resolved

---

## 📦 Artifact Management

### Build Artifacts
- Package distributions uploaded
- Security reports archived
- Verification reports retained (7 days)
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov

- Verification gate results
- Security scan findings

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Execution
```bash
# Parallel execution across all cores
pytest -n=auto

pytest --reruns=2 --reruns-delay=1

# Stop on 5th failure
pytest --maxfail=5
```

### Coverage Requirements
