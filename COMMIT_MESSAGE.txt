fix(ci): Add missing observability workflows and dependencies for Stage 6.7-6.8.1

This commit resolves all merge-blocking CI/CD issues for the observability-intelligence feature branch.

## Changes Made:

### New GitHub Actions Workflows (3 files):
- Add .github/workflows/observability.yml
  * Tests observability & runtime intelligence components
  * Validates Prometheus alert rules
  * Checks observability hooks integration
  * Runs pytest with coverage reporting
  
- Add .github/workflows/stage-readiness-check.yml
  * Automated stage verification using verify_stage_readiness.py
  * Auto-comments on PRs with verification results
  * Uploads JSON reports as artifacts
  * Blocks merge if critical checks fail
  
- Add .github/workflows/chaos-engineering.yml
  * Validates chaos engineering configuration
  * Tests chaos scenarios in dry-run mode
  * Validates SLO and remediation rule configs
  * Scheduled weekly chaos testing

### New Validation Scripts (1 file):
- Implement scripts/validate_alert_rules.py
  * Full YAML syntax validation for Prometheus alerts
  * Checks required fields (alert, expr, labels, annotations)
  * Validates both alerting and recording rules
  * Provides detailed error/warning reports

### Updated Dependencies:
- Update .github/workflows/ci.yml
  * Install observability/observability_requirements.txt
  * Ensures ML dependencies available in CI
  
- Update requirements.txt
  * Add numpy>=1.21.0 for ML anomaly detection
  * Add scipy>=1.7.0 for statistical analysis
  * Add schedule>=1.1.0 for scheduled jobs

### Documentation (3 files):
- CI_WORKFLOW_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md - Complete root-cause analysis
- QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md - Fast-track developer guide  
- CI_FIXES_SUMMARY.md - Implementation summary

## Root Cause:
Stage 6.7-6.8.1 implementation created verify_stage_readiness.py script that checks
for CI workflows, but the workflows themselves were never created. This caused
stage readiness verification to fail and blocked merge to main.

## Impact:
- Resolves merge-blocking issues for v6.7.0 release
- Enables automated observability testing in CI/CD
- Provides automated PR verification for stage readiness
- Adds chaos engineering validation to pipeline

## Testing:
- All workflows validated with yamllint
- Local verification: python scripts/verify_stage_readiness.py
- Expected CI duration: ~5 minutes (workflows run in parallel)

## Breaking Changes:
None - all changes are additive

## Related Issues:
- Stage 6.7: Observability & Metrics
- Stage 6.8: Runtime Intelligence
- Stage 6.8.1: AI Incident Analyzer
- v6.7.0 release preparation

Resolves merge-blocking CI failures
