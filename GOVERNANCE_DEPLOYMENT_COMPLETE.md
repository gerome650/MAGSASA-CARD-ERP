## üöÄ How to Use the Governance System

### For Developers

#### Creating a New PR
1. **Reference a spec** in your PR description:
   ```markdown
   Spec: /specs/my-feature.md
   ```
2. **Ensure test coverage** is ‚â•80%
3. **Run pre-commit checks** locally:
   ```bash
   make hygiene
   make coverage-check
   ```

#### Running Local Checks
```bash
# Quick hygiene check
make hygiene

# Run all governance checks
make check-policy

# Calculate merge readiness score
make calculate-merge-score

# Generate governance report
make governance-report
```

### For CI/CD Pipeline

The governance workflow automatically triggers on:
- `pull_request` events: `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `edited`
- Target branches: `main`, `master`, `develop`, `release/*`, `feature/*`

### Viewing Results

1. **GitHub Actions UI:**
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/gerome650/MAGSASA-CARD-ERP/actions`
   - Look for workflow: "üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è PR Governance Validation"

2. **PR Comments:**
   - Governance checks post summary comments on PRs
   - Shows pass/fail status for each check
   - Provides actionable feedback

3. **Workflow Logs:**
   - Click on any workflow run to see detailed logs
   - Each job shows specific failures and how to fix them

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Makefile Commands

### Governance & Policy
```bash
make install-governance-hooks    # Install pre-commit and post-push hooks
make check-policy                # Check policy compliance
make enforce-coverage            # Enforce coverage thresholds
make governance-report           # Generate comprehensive report
make governance-status           # Show governance system status
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make hygiene                     # Run black --check and ruff
make fix-lint                    # Auto-fix lint issues
make coverage-check              # Run tests with coverage enforcement
make safe-commit MSG="message"   # Protected commit with all checks
```

### Testing
```bash
make test                        # Run full test suite
make test-fast                   # Quick test run (no coverage)
make coverage-local              # Local coverage with HTML report
make coverage-ci                 # CI coverage with strict enforcement
```

## üìä Governance Enforcement Levels

### Pre-Commit (Local)
- Code formatting (Black)
- Linting (Ruff)
- Import validation
- Secrets scanning

### Pre-Push (Local)

- Secrets scanning
- Coverage enforcement (‚â•80%)
- Ruff linting

### Merge Gate (CI)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pre-commit hook blocks commit
**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Fix the issues
make fix-lint
make hygiene

# Option 2: Bypass for emergency commits
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

### Issue: Coverage below threshold
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run coverage report to see gaps
make coverage-report

# Add tests for uncovered code
# Re-run to verify
make coverage-check
```

### Issue: Ruff linting errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Auto-fix safe issues
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Auto-fix with unsafe fixes
uv run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .

# Format code
uv run black .
```

### Issue: Spec reference missing
**Solution:**
Add a spec reference to your PR description:
```markdown
Spec: /specs/feature-name.md
```
Or create a spec first:
```bash
cp specs/spec-template.md specs/my-feature.md
# Edit the spec
# Reference it in your PR
```

---

## üìà Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Merge this PR** to activate governance on `main` branch
2. ‚úÖ **Create a test PR** to verify governance checks trigger
3. ‚úÖ **Install local hooks** on your development machine:
   ```bash
   make install-governance-hooks
   ```

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Review governance reports** weekly: `make governance-report`
- **Monitor coverage trends** monthly: `make coverage-trend`
- **Update policies** as needed in `merge_policy.yml`
- **Add specs** for all new features in `specs/` directory

### Team Onboarding
1. Share `GOVERNANCE_WORKFLOW_QUICK_START.md` with team
2. Ensure all developers run `make install-governance-hooks`
3. Create specs for upcoming features
4. Conduct a governance review meeting
