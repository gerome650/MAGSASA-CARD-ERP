# 🚨 Governance Heartbeat Anomaly Detection

## Overview
The Governance Heartbeat workflow now includes **intelligent anomaly detection** and **auto-labeling** capabilities to transform it from a simple status reporter into a real governance sensor.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Configurable Thresholds**
Default thresholds are defined at the job level:
- **Uptime**: 98.0% (minimum acceptable)
- **Latency**: 4000ms (maximum acceptable)
- **Error Rate**: 2.0% (maximum acceptable)

Located in `.github/workflows/governance-heartbeat.yml`:
```yaml
env:
  UPTIME_THRESHOLD: "98.0"
  LATENCY_THRESHOLD: "4000"
  ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD: "2.0"
```

### 2. **Anomaly Detection Step**
Automatically analyzes metrics from Render and compares them against thresholds:
- ✅ **Healthy**: All metrics within acceptable ranges
- ⚠️ **Drift Detected**: One or more metrics exceed thresholds

The detection logic:
- Skips unavailable metrics gracefully
- Aggregates multiple violations into a single message
- Outputs `status` and `message` for downstream use

### 3. **Auto-Labeling**
Issues are automatically labeled based on health status:
- `⚠️ drift-detected` - When any threshold is exceeded
- `✅ healthy` - When all metrics are within range

Labels are applied automatically on both:
- New issue creation
- Existing issue updates

### 4. **Enhanced Slack Notifications**
Slack messages now include anomaly status:
```
✅ Governance Heartbeat Metrics
🧭 Uptime: 99.2%
⚡ Latency: 350 ms
🚨 Error Rate: 0.5%

✅ All metrics within thresholds.
```

Or when drift is detected:
```
✅ Governance Heartbeat Metrics
🧭 Uptime: 96.5%
⚡ Latency: 5200 ms
🚨 Error Rate: 3.2%

⚠️ Uptime below threshold (96.5% < 98.0%); Latency above threshold (5200 ms > 4000 ms); Error rate above threshold (3.2% > 2.0%)
```

### 5. **Issue Body Enhancement**
Every heartbeat issue now includes an **Anomaly Detection Status** section:

```markdown
## 🚨 Anomaly Detection Status
✅ All metrics within thresholds.
```

Or when there are problems:
```markdown
## 🚨 Anomaly Detection Status
⚠️ Uptime below threshold (96.5% < 98.0%); Latency above threshold (5200 ms > 4000 ms)
```

### 6. **📜 Anomaly History Tracking**
Every heartbeat run now **appends its anomaly data to `governance-history.json`** in the repository:

**Features:**
- Creates an audit trail of all governance metrics over time
- Automatically commits history after each run with `[skip ci]` to avoid workflow loops
- Uses `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- Gracefully handles missing files (creates new file if needed)
- Stores: timestamp, uptime, latency, error_rate, status, and message

**Example history entry:**
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-09T16:42:00Z",
    "uptime": "97.8",
    "latency": "4321",
    "error_rate": "2.3",
    "status": "drift-detected",
    "message": "⚠️ Latency above threshold (4321 ms > 4000 ms)"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2026-01-07T12:00:00Z",
    "uptime": "99.2",
    "latency": "3300",
    "error_rate": "1.2",
    "status": "healthy",
    "message": "✅ All metrics within thresholds."
  }
]
```

**Benefits:**
- 📊 Track drift patterns over time
- 📈 Analyze long-term stability trends
- 🔍 Identify recurring anomalies
- 📝 Maintain verifiable governance trail
- 🚀 No external database required

## 🎯 How It Works

### Workflow Execution Flow
```
1. Fetch Render Metrics
   ↓
2. Analyze for Anomalies
   ↓
3. Append to governance-history.json
   ↓
4. Commit & Push History (with --no-verify)
   ↓
5. Post to Slack (with anomaly status)
   ↓
6. Create/Update Issue (with auto-label)
```

### Job Outputs
The `heartbeat-metrics-ping` job now provides:
- `uptime` - Uptime percentage
- `latency` - Latency in milliseconds
- `error_rate` - Error rate percentage
- `anomaly_status` - "healthy" or "drift-detected"
- `anomaly_message` - Human-readable status message

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjusting Thresholds
To modify detection sensitivity, edit the environment variables in the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  UPTIME_THRESHOLD: "99.5"      # Stricter uptime requirement
  LATENCY_THRESHOLD: "2000"     # Lower latency tolerance
  ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD: "1.0"   # Stricter error rate
```

### Required Secrets
Ensure these secrets are configured in your repository:
- `RENDER_API_KEY` - Your Render API authentication key
- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` - Your Render service identifier
- `SLACK_GOVERNANCE_WEBHOOK` - Slack webhook URL for notifications

## 📊 Benefits

### Before
- ✅ Collects metrics
- ✅ Posts to Slack
- ✅ Creates issue

### After
- ✅ Collects metrics
- ✅ **Detects anomalies automatically**
- ✅ **Appends history to governance-history.json**
- ✅ **Auto-commits history with [skip ci]**
- ✅ Posts to Slack **with drift warnings**
- ✅ Creates issue **with auto-labeling**
- ✅ **Creates persistent audit trail over time**

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### GitHub Labels
Issues are tagged with color-coded labels for quick identification:
- 🟢 `✅ healthy` - Green label for healthy systems
- 🟡 `⚠️ drift-detected` - Yellow/orange label for attention needed

### Filtering
Find all drift issues quickly:
```
label:"⚠️ drift-detected" is:open
```

Find all healthy reports:
```
label:"✅ healthy" is:closed
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Manual Trigger
Test the workflow manually:
```bash
gh workflow run governance-heartbeat.yml
```

### Scheduled Execution
The workflow runs automatically every 3 months on the 1st at 12:00 UTC.

### Monitoring
Check the workflow runs:
```bash
gh run list --workflow=governance-heartbeat.yml
```

### Accessing History Data
View the governance history file:
```bash
cat governance-history.json | jq '.'
```

Get the latest anomaly record:
```bash
cat governance-history.json | jq '.[-1]'
```

Find all drift-detected events:
```bash
cat governance-history.json | jq '.[] | select(.status == "drift-detected")'
```

Count healthy vs. drift events:
```bash
echo "Healthy: $(cat governance-history.json | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "healthy")] | length')"
echo "Drift: $(cat governance-history.json | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "drift-detected")] | length')"
```

## 🧪 Testing

To test anomaly detection, temporarily adjust thresholds to trigger alerts:

```yaml
env:
  UPTIME_THRESHOLD: "99.99"     # Very strict - likely to trigger
  LATENCY_THRESHOLD: "100"      # Very strict - likely to trigger
  ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD: "0.1"   # Very strict - likely to trigger
```

Run the workflow and verify:
1. ⚠️ Slack message shows drift warning
2. 🏷 Issue is labeled with `⚠️ drift-detected`
3. 📝 Issue body contains anomaly details

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential additions for the next iteration:
- ✅ ~~**Drift History**: Track anomalies over time~~ **IMPLEMENTED** (governance-history.json)
- 🚨 **Escalation Webhook**: High-severity alerts to different channel
- 📉 **Trend Analysis**: Compare against historical baselines using governance-history.json
- 🔔 **PagerDuty Integration**: Critical alerts to on-call team
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Visual representation of governance health from history data
- 📈 **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate rolling averages and standard deviations from history
